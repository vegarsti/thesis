In this thesis, we work with boosting for regression in the first hitting time model. First hitting time is a model in survival analysis which serves as an alternative to the proportional hazards model, typically known as Cox regression. Developments in FHT regression are relatively recent, and there has to our knowledge been no attempt at tackling it in the high-dimensional case, in which boosting is an appropriate choice of method.
