\chapter{Acknowledgements}
This thesis concludes five years of studies at the University of Oslo.
I have learned a whole lot over these years, and I have had a lot of fun.
Most of all, I would like to thank my thesis supervisor, Riccardo de Bin, for suggesting a very interesting thesis plan.
It has been very interesting to learn a lot about both survival analysis and boosting.
Thank you so much for all your helpful comments, feedback, and encouragement.
All errors in this thesis are surely mine!

Thank you, Mathias, Kristian, and Andreas, for working together almost every day for the first three years, and for all discussions and laughs we shared.
Thank you, Eirik, for these recent two years, and for all lunch breaks, laughs, discussions, and help.
Working on this thesis has been more fun with you around.
Each of the four of you has become a good friend and made my life a lot better these years, so thanks!
Thanks to mom and dad, for believing in me, encouraging me, and for asking about my thesis.
It has been fun trying to explain what I have been working on!
Finally, thanks to my amazing wife, Gjertrud, for your patience, warmth, and encouragement.
