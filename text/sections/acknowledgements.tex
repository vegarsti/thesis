\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would first like to thank my thesis supervisor, Riccardo de Bin.
Thanks for introducing me to two interesting fields.
Before starting the work of this thesis, I knew nothing about survival analysis, and nothing about boosting.
Now I know a lot more!
Thanks for the always helpful discussions about my work.

This thesis concludes five years of studies at the University of Oslo.
I have learned a lot.
Thanks to fellow students for making these years fun and educating.
I would especially like to thank Mathias, Kristian, Eirik, and Andreas.
Each of you has become a good friend, and you have made my life a lot better these years.

Thanks to mom and dad, for always believing in me, and for instilling in me a love for knowledge.
Thanks also for your questions about my research, it has been fun trying to explain it to you.
