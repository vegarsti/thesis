   abstract = {This paper introduces the R package threg, which implements the estimation procedure of a threshold regression model, which is based on the first-hitting-time of a boundary by the sample path of a Wiener diffusion process. The threshold regression methodology is well suited to applications involving survival and time-to-event data, and serves as an important alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model.This new package includes four functions: threg, and the methods hr, predict and plot for ‘threg’ objects returned by threg. The threg function is the model-fitting function which is used to calculate regression coefficient estimates, asymptotic standard errors and p values. The hr method for ‘threg’ objects is the hazard-ratio calculation function which provides the estimates of hazard ratios at selected time points for specified scenarios (based on given categories or value settings of covariates). The predict method for ‘threg objects is used for prediction. And the plot method for ‘threg’ objects provides plots for curves of estimated hazard functions, survival functions and probability density functions of the first-hitting-time; function curves corresponding to different scenarios can be overlaid in the same plot for comparison to give additional research insights.},

  abstract="Proportional hazards (PH) regression is a standard methodology for analyzing survival and time-to-event data. The proportional hazards assumption of PH regression, however, is not always appropriate. In addition, PH regression focuses mainly on hazard ratios and thus does not offer many insights into underlying determinants of survival. These limitations have led statistical researchers to explore alternative methodologies. Threshold regression (TR) is one of these alternative methodologies (see Lee and Whitmore, Stat Sci 21:501--513, 2006, for a review). The connection between PH regression and TR has been examined in previous published work but the investigations have been limited in scope. In this article, we study the connections between these two regression methodologies in greater depth and show that PH regression is, for most purposes, a special case of TR. We show two methods of construction by which TR models can yield PH functions for survival times, one based on altering the TR time scale and the other based on varying the TR boundary. We discuss how to estimate the TR time scale and boundary, with or without the PH assumption. A case demonstration is used to highlight the greater understanding of scientific foundations that TR can offer in comparison to PH regression. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of positioning PH regression within the first-hitting-time context of TR regression.",

A concept class is learnable (or strongly learnable) if, given access to a source of examples of the unknown concept, the learner with high probability is able to output an hypothesis that is correct on all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the instances. The concept class is weakly learnable if the learner can produce an hypothesis that performs only slightly better than random guessing.

  abstract="Despite the limitations imposed by the proportional hazards assumption, the Cox model is probably the most popular statistical tool used to analyze survival data, thanks to its flexibility and ease of interpretation. For this reason, novel statistical/machine learning techniques are usually adapted to fit its requirements, including boosting. Boosting is an iterative technique originally developed in the machine learning community to handle classification problems, and later extended to the statistical field, where it is used in many situations, including regression and survival analysis. The popularity of boosting has been further driven by the availability of user-friendly software such as the R packages mboost and CoxBoost, both of which allow the implementation of boosting in conjunction with the Cox model. Despite the common underlying boosting principles, these two packages use different techniques: the former is an adaptation of model-based boosting, while the latter adapts likelihood-based boosting. Here we contrast these two boosting techniques as implemented in the R packages from an analytic point of view; we further examine solutions adopted within these packages to treat mandatory variables, i.e. variables that---for several reasons---must be included in the model. We explore the possibility of extending solutions currently only implemented in one package to the other. A simulation study and a real data example are added for illustration.",

 abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated the practical and theoretical value of using first-passage-time distributions as models of duration data (e.g., equipment lives, hospital stays, employee service times). The inverse Gaussian distribution is the principal example of this type. Methods have been developed for handling regression structures and censoring for the inverse Gaussian model in order to cope with these features in real data. This paper discusses the use of first-passage-time distributions connected with multidimensional Brownian motion as models for duration data which are subject to competing risks (i.e., multiple failure modes). The approach is a natural extension of the regression methodology for censored inverse Gaussian data published previously by the author. Several case applications of the competing-risks formulation are presented.},

  abstract = {Survival prediction from high-dimensional genomic data is dependent on a proper regularization method. With an increasing number of such methods proposed in the literature, comparative studies are called for and some have been performed. However, there is currently no consensus on which prediction assessment criterion should be used for time-to-event data. Without a firm knowledge about whether the choice of evaluation criterion may affect the conclusions made as to which regularization method performs best, these comparative studies may be of limited value. In this paper, four evaluation criteria are investigated: the log-rank test for two groups, the area under the time-dependent ROC curve (AUC), an R2-measure based on the Cox partial likelihood, and an R2-measure based on the Brier score. The criteria are compared according to how they rank six widely used regularization methods that are based on the Cox regression model, namely univariate selection, principal components regression (PCR), supervised PCR, partial least squares regression, ridge regression, and the lasso. Based on our application to three microarray gene expression data sets, we find that the results obtained from the widely used log-rank test deviate from the other three criteria studied. For future studies, where one also might want to include non-likelihood or non-model-based regularization methods, we argue in favor of AUC and the R2-measure based on the Brier score, as these do not suffer from the arbitrary splitting into two groups nor depend on the Cox partial likelihood.}

  abstract="In biomedical research, boosting-based regression approaches have gained much attention in the last decade. Their intrinsic variable selection procedure and ability to shrink the estimates of the regression coefficients toward 0 make these techniques appropriate to fit prediction models in the case of high-dimensional data, e.g. gene expressions. Their prediction performance, however, highly depends on specific tuning parameters, in particular on the number of boosting iterations to perform. This crucial parameter is usually selected via cross-validation. The cross-validation procedure may highly depend on a completely random component, namely the considered fold partition. We empirically study how much this randomness affects the results of the boosting techniques, in terms of selected predictors and prediction ability of the related models. We use four publicly available data sets related to four different diseases. In these studies, the goal is to predict survival end-points when a large number of continuous candidate predictors are available. We focus on two well known boosting approaches implemented in the R-packages CoxBoost and mboost, assuming the validity of the proportional hazards assumption and the linearity of the effects of the predictors. We show that the variability in selected predictors and prediction ability of the model is reduced by averaging over several repetitions of cross-validation in the selection of the tuning parameters.",

  abstract = {Abstract Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data have gained a lot of attention in the last few years as they are a helpful technique clinical studies where longitudinal outcomes are recorded alongside event times. Those two processes are often linked and the two outcomes should thus be modeled jointly in order to prevent the potential bias introduced by independent modeling. Commonly, joint models are estimated in likelihood-based expectation maximization or Bayesian approaches using frameworks where variable selection is problematic and that do not immediately work for high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a boosting algorithm tackling these challenges by being able to simultaneously estimate predictors for joint models and automatically select the most influential variables even in high-dimensional data situations. We analyze the performance of the new algorithm in a simulation study and apply it to the Danish cystic fibrosis registry that collects longitudinal lung function data on patients with cystic fibrosis together with data regarding the onset of pulmonary infections. This is the first approach to combine state-of-the art algorithms from the field of machine-learning with the model class of joint models, providing a fully data-driven mechanism to select variables and predictor effects in a unified framework of boosting joint models.}

A notable feature of boosting is that the technique can be modified such that it includes a built-in mechanism for shrinking coefficient estimates and variable selection. This regularization mechanism makes boosting a suitable method for analyzing data characterized by small sample sizes and large numbers of predictors. We extend the existing methodology by developing a boosting method for prediction functions with multiple components. Such multidimensional functions occur in many types of statistical models, for example in count data models and in models involving outcome variables with a mixture distribution. As will be demonstrated, the new algorithm is suitable for both the estimation of the prediction function and regularization of the estimates. In addition, nuisance parameters can be estimated simultaneously with the prediction function.",

The model is fitted repeatedly to subsampled data, and variables with high selection frequencies are extracted. To apply stability selection to boosted GAMLSS, we develop a new ``noncyclical'' fitting algorithm that incorporates an additional selection step of the best-fitting distribution parameter in each iteration. This new algorithm has the additional advantage that optimizing the tuning parameters of boosting is reduced from a multi-dimensional to a one-dimensional problem with vastly decreased complexity. The performance of the novel algorithm is evaluated in an extensive simulation study. We apply this new algorithm to a study to estimate abundance of common eider in Massachusetts, USA, featuring excess zeros, overdispersion, nonlinearity and spatiotemporal structures. Eider abundance is estimated via boosted GAMLSS, allowing both mean and overdispersion to be regressed on covariates. Stability selection is used to obtain a sparse set of stable predictors.",

Current fitting procedures for GAMLSSs are infeasible for high dimensional data set-ups and require variable selection based on (potentially problematic) information criteria. The present work describes a boosting algorithm for high dimensional GAMLSSs that was developed to overcome these limitations. Specifically, the new algorithm was designed to allow the simultaneous estimation of predictor effects and variable selection. The algorithm proposed was applied to Munich rental guide data, which are used by landlords and tenants as a reference for the average rent of a flat depending on its characteristics and spatial features. The net rent predictions that resulted from the high dimensional GAMLSSs were found to be highly competitive and covariate-specific prediction intervals showed a major improvement over classical generalized additive models.},

  abstract="Methods for voting classification algorithms, such as Bagging and AdaBoost, have been shown to be very successful in improving the accuracy of certain classifiers for artificial and real-world datasets. We review these algorithms and describe a large empirical study comparing several variants in conjunction with a decision tree inducer (three variants) and a Naive-Bayes inducer. The purpose of the study is to improve our understanding of why and when these algorithms, which use perturbation, reweighting, and combination techniques, affect classification error. We provide a bias and variance decomposition of the error to show how different methods and variants influence these two terms. This allowed us to determine that Bagging reduced variance of unstable methods, while boosting methods (AdaBoost and Arc-x4) reduced both the bias and variance of unstable methods but increased the variance for Naive-Bayes, which was very stable. We observed that Arc-x4 behaves differently than AdaBoost if reweighting is used instead of resampling, indicating a fundamental difference. Voting variants, some of which are introduced in this paper, include: pruning versus no pruning, use of probabilistic estimates, weight perturbations (Wagging), and backfitting of data. We found that Bagging improves when probabilistic estimates in conjunction with no-pruning are used, as well as when the data was backfit. We measure tree sizes and show an interesting positive correlation between the increase in the average tree size in AdaBoost trials and its success in reducing the error. We compare the mean-squared error of voting methods to non-voting methods and show that the voting methods lead to large and significant reductions in the mean-squared errors. Practical problems that arise in implementing boosting algorithms are explored, including numerical instabilities and underflows. We use scatterplots that graphically show how AdaBoost reweights instances, emphasizing not only ``hard'' areas but also outliers and noise.",

The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton-Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {Abstract Prognostic classification schemes have often been used in medical applications, but rarely subjected to a rigorous examination of their adequacy. For survival data, the statistical methodology to assess such schemes consists mainly of a range of ad hoc approaches, and there is an alarming lack of commonly accepted standards in this field. We review these methods and develop measures of inaccuracy which may be calculated in a validation study in order to assess the usefulness of estimated patient-specific survival probabilities associated with a prognostic classification scheme. These measures are meaningful even when the estimated probabilities are misspecified, and asymptotically they are not affected by random censorship. In addition, they can be used to derive R2-type measures of explained residual variation. A breast cancer study will serve for illustration throughout the paper.

As far as possible, prior applications of the various models to this process are reviewed, and the models are conceptualized on the individual and aggregate level. The models are the exponential, mixed exponential, type XI, Weibull, gamma, lognormal and Inverse Gaussian. The lognormal and Inverse Gaussian show the best fits to the data in terms of the maximum absolute deviation. However, the Inverse Gaussian is superior due to its attractive statistical characterization. Special attention is given to the relatively new Inverse Gaussian, and there is a brief section on LOS and theory verification. Recommendations are made for future LOS research.

 abstract = {This paper is a study of the nature of the frequency distribution of the duration of strikes in the United Kingdom as recorded by the Department of Employment. The settlement of a strike is regarded as a probabilistic process and the duration of a strike is treated as an observation on a random variable. A model for this random duration is created by supposing that at each point of time after the commencement of a strike there exists an index of the difference between the parties to the dispute. This index is itself regarded as a one-dimensional stochastic process in continuous time and space and determines the duration of the strike by the first point of time at which the difference index passes through an absorbing barrier representing "agreement". The duration of a strike then becomes the First Passage time of a stochastic process to a single absorbing barrier. As a first approximation the index process is assumed to be simple Brownian motion with drift and in consequence the duration of a strike has the Inverse Gaussian for its probability distribution. The fit of this distribution to the observations is shown to be, with few exceptions, very close.},

 abstract = {A Wiener process with drift is presented as a model of employee job attachment. The model implies a defective inverse Gaussian distribution form for employee service times. The inverse Gaussian form is fitted to some published employee-service data with encouraging results. The model's contribution to our understanding of occupational variables and employment experience is discussed. It is shown that the model provides a useful basis for formulating and testing hypotheses about labour turnover phenomena. Although the primary emphasis is on the statistical aspects of the subject, some practical implications for the personnel and labour fields are considered.},

abstract="Most materials and components degrade physically before they fail. Engineering degradation tests are designed to measure these degradation processes. Measurements in the tests reflect the inherent randomness of degradation itself as well as measurement errors created by imperfect instruments, procedures and environments. This paper describes a statistical model for measured degradation data that takes both sources of variation into account. The degradation process in the model is taken to be a Wiener diffusion process. The measurement errors are assumed to be independent normal random outcomes that are independent of the degradation process. The paper describes inference procedures for the model and discusses some practical issues that must be considered in dealing with the statistical problem. A case study is presented.",
