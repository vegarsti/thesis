   abstract = {This paper introduces the R package threg, which implements the estimation procedure of a threshold regression model, which is based on the first-hitting-time of a boundary by the sample path of a Wiener diffusion process. The threshold regression methodology is well suited to applications involving survival and time-to-event data, and serves as an important alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model.This new package includes four functions: threg, and the methods hr, predict and plot for ‘threg’ objects returned by threg. The threg function is the model-fitting function which is used to calculate regression coefficient estimates, asymptotic standard errors and p values. The hr method for ‘threg’ objects is the hazard-ratio calculation function which provides the estimates of hazard ratios at selected time points for specified scenarios (based on given categories or value settings of covariates). The predict method for ‘threg objects is used for prediction. And the plot method for ‘threg’ objects provides plots for curves of estimated hazard functions, survival functions and probability density functions of the first-hitting-time; function curves corresponding to different scenarios can be overlaid in the same plot for comparison to give additional research insights.},

  abstract="Proportional hazards (PH) regression is a standard methodology for analyzing survival and time-to-event data. The proportional hazards assumption of PH regression, however, is not always appropriate. In addition, PH regression focuses mainly on hazard ratios and thus does not offer many insights into underlying determinants of survival. These limitations have led statistical researchers to explore alternative methodologies. Threshold regression (TR) is one of these alternative methodologies (see Lee and Whitmore, Stat Sci 21:501--513, 2006, for a review). The connection between PH regression and TR has been examined in previous published work but the investigations have been limited in scope. In this article, we study the connections between these two regression methodologies in greater depth and show that PH regression is, for most purposes, a special case of TR. We show two methods of construction by which TR models can yield PH functions for survival times, one based on altering the TR time scale and the other based on varying the TR boundary. We discuss how to estimate the TR time scale and boundary, with or without the PH assumption. A case demonstration is used to highlight the greater understanding of scientific foundations that TR can offer in comparison to PH regression. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of positioning PH regression within the first-hitting-time context of TR regression.",

  abstract="This paper addresses the problem of improving the accuracy of an hypothesis output by a learning algorithm in the distribution-free (PAC) learning model. A concept class is learnable (or strongly learnable) if, given access to a source of examples of the unknown concept, the learner with high probability is able to output an hypothesis that is correct on all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the instances. The concept class is weakly learnable if the learner can produce an hypothesis that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In this paper, it is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent.",

We give a theoretical background and demonstrate how mboost can be used to fit interpretable models of different complexity. As an example we use mboost to predict the body fat based on anthropometric measurements throughout the tutorial.",

  abstract="Despite the limitations imposed by the proportional hazards assumption, the Cox model is probably the most popular statistical tool used to analyze survival data, thanks to its flexibility and ease of interpretation. For this reason, novel statistical/machine learning techniques are usually adapted to fit its requirements, including boosting. Boosting is an iterative technique originally developed in the machine learning community to handle classification problems, and later extended to the statistical field, where it is used in many situations, including regression and survival analysis. The popularity of boosting has been further driven by the availability of user-friendly software such as the R packages mboost and CoxBoost, both of which allow the implementation of boosting in conjunction with the Cox model. Despite the common underlying boosting principles, these two packages use different techniques: the former is an adaptation of model-based boosting, while the latter adapts likelihood-based boosting. Here we contrast these two boosting techniques as implemented in the R packages from an analytic point of view; we further examine solutions adopted within these packages to treat mandatory variables, i.e. variables that---for several reasons---must be included in the model. We explore the possibility of extending solutions currently only implemented in one package to the other. A simulation study and a real data example are added for illustration.",

 abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated the practical and theoretical value of using first-passage-time distributions as models of duration data (e.g., equipment lives, hospital stays, employee service times). The inverse Gaussian distribution is the principal example of this type. Methods have been developed for handling regression structures and censoring for the inverse Gaussian model in order to cope with these features in real data. This paper discusses the use of first-passage-time distributions connected with multidimensional Brownian motion as models for duration data which are subject to competing risks (i.e., multiple failure modes). The approach is a natural extension of the regression methodology for censored inverse Gaussian data published previously by the author. Several case applications of the competing-risks formulation are presented.},
