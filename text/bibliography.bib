   abstract = {This paper introduces the R package threg, which implements the estimation procedure of a threshold regression model, which is based on the first-hitting-time of a boundary by the sample path of a Wiener diffusion process. The threshold regression methodology is well suited to applications involving survival and time-to-event data, and serves as an important alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model.This new package includes four functions: threg, and the methods hr, predict and plot for ‘threg’ objects returned by threg. The threg function is the model-fitting function which is used to calculate regression coefficient estimates, asymptotic standard errors and p values. The hr method for ‘threg’ objects is the hazard-ratio calculation function which provides the estimates of hazard ratios at selected time points for specified scenarios (based on given categories or value settings of covariates). The predict method for ‘threg objects is used for prediction. And the plot method for ‘threg’ objects provides plots for curves of estimated hazard functions, survival functions and probability density functions of the first-hitting-time; function curves corresponding to different scenarios can be overlaid in the same plot for comparison to give additional research insights.},

  abstract="Proportional hazards (PH) regression is a standard methodology for analyzing survival and time-to-event data. The proportional hazards assumption of PH regression, however, is not always appropriate. In addition, PH regression focuses mainly on hazard ratios and thus does not offer many insights into underlying determinants of survival. These limitations have led statistical researchers to explore alternative methodologies. Threshold regression (TR) is one of these alternative methodologies (see Lee and Whitmore, Stat Sci 21:501--513, 2006, for a review). The connection between PH regression and TR has been examined in previous published work but the investigations have been limited in scope. In this article, we study the connections between these two regression methodologies in greater depth and show that PH regression is, for most purposes, a special case of TR. We show two methods of construction by which TR models can yield PH functions for survival times, one based on altering the TR time scale and the other based on varying the TR boundary. We discuss how to estimate the TR time scale and boundary, with or without the PH assumption. A case demonstration is used to highlight the greater understanding of scientific foundations that TR can offer in comparison to PH regression. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of positioning PH regression within the first-hitting-time context of TR regression.",
