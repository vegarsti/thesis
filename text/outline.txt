- Intro: Motivation for the thesis work
    + FHT has no high-dim regression
    + Survival analysis needs non-Cox (non-PH) high-dim modelling
- Survival analysis intro/setting
- Proportional hazards problems
- Why PH property does not work in variable selection
- FHT model
- Boosting: Origin
- Component-wise Boosting
- Component-wise boosting of FHT
- Evaluation of FHTBoost
- Simulation of data
- Cross validation
- Actual data
