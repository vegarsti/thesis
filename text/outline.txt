# Chapter 1: Introduction
Motivation. Why?
    - FHT has no high-dim regression
    - Survival analysis needs non-Cox (non-PH) high-dim modelling


# Chapter 2: Survival analysis, FHT IG model
- Survival analysis setting
- Simulation of survival times
- Cox / proportional hazard (PH)
- PH problems (variable selection)
- FHT model
- Illustration
- Simulation of Cox data


# Chapter 3: Boosting
- Statistical learning theory
- AdaBoost to L2Boost
- Component-wise boosting (L2Boost, I guess)
- Illustration of boosting -- & variable selection
- Choosing m_stop
- CV and repeated CV
- Joint boosting


# Chapter 4: FHT Boost
- Explanation of algorithm
- Illustration
- Improvements


# Chapter 5: Results
- Comparison on PH simulated data with CoxBoost
- Comparison on actual data with CoxBoost


# Chapter 7: Conclusion and future work
