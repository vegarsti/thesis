1 Introduction

2 Survival analysis and data
- Problem setting/motivation
- Data structures
- Regression
- Proportional hazards: Cox model
- Problem with proportional hazards, esp. in high dims
- Examples

2 First Hitting Time
- General model
- Choices of processes
- Wiener --> IG FHT
- Regression here: Likelihood
- Examples
- Model checking?
- Collinearity problems

3 Boosting
- Boosting idea
- AdaBoost
- Boosting / Forward Stagewise Additive Modelling
- Gradient descent
- Gradient boosting: Gradient Descent in Function Space
- Componentwise Gradient Boosting
- Componentwise GB with several loss functions
- When to stop: CV vs AIC

4 Boosting for FHT
- Algorithms
- 1: m from 1 to M; boost both in same iteration
- 2: two boosting loops
- Comparison

5 Implementation of boosting algorithms
- Numerical tricks 

6 Comparison with CoxBoost

7 Application on cancer data
