1 Introduction

2 Survival analysis and data
- Problem setting/motivation
- Data structures
- Regression
- Proportional hazards: Cox model
- Problem with proportional hazards, esp. in high dims
- Examples

2 First Hitting Time
- General model
- Choices of processes
- Wiener --> IG FHT
- Regression here: Likelihood
- Examples
- Model checking?
- Collinearity problems

3 Boosting
- Boosting idea
- AdaBoost
- Boosting / Forward Stagewise Additive Modelling
- Gradient descent
- Gradient boosting: Gradient Descent in Function Space
- L2Boost (& asymptotic results on consistency)
- Componentwise Gradient Boosting
- Componentwise GB with several loss functions
- When to stop: CV vs AIC

4 Boosting for FHT
- Algorithms
- 1: m from 1 to M; boost both in same iteration
    * first m from 1 to min(M_1, M_2)
    * then  m from min(M_1,M_2) to max(M_1, M_2)
        only boost latter
- 2: two boosting loops??
- Comparison

5 Implementation of boosting algorithms
- Numerical tricks 

6 Comparison with CoxBoost

7 Application on cancer data

8 Conclusion/discussion/further work

Appendix:
- derivation of pdf/cdf of wiener FHT
    * laplace transform of pdf?
- derivation of loss functions
